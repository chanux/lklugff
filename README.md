=======

Here is my attempt at converting lklug sinhala unicode true type font to webfont and using it with @font-face css rule.
I used a step by step guide to convert which I can't remember/find now.
IIRC I tried this in 2011. Throwing it out there so anyone interested can play with it (I'm probably a bit late). 

Check it in action [here](http://chanux.github.io/lklug-webfont)

*The reder part is currently broken becuase viewtext.org is down :(*
